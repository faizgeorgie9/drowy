# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project was developed as part of the **Basic Machine Learning** course.  
The objective of this project is to classify driver drowsiness levels using facial image analysis in order to support road safety.

The system classifies facial images into three drowsiness levels:
- **Alert**
- **Low Vigilant**
- **Drowsy**

## Project Background
Driver drowsiness is a critical factor contributing to traffic accidents. Visual indicators such as closed eyes, drooping eyelids, and open mouth can be extracted from facial images and analyzed using machine learning techniques. This project explores multiple classification approaches to identify drowsiness levels effectively.

## Methods Used
The following machine learning methods were implemented and compared:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Backpropagation Neural Network**
- **Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ)**

Each model was trained and evaluated to analyze its performance in classifying drowsiness levels.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of facial images categorized into three classes:
- Alert
- Low Vigilant
- Drowsy

Image preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and feature extraction prior to model training.

## Project Structure
- Training scripts and preprocessing code
- Model implementation files
- Evaluation and testing scripts
